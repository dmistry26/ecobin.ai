# ecobin

hello, thanks for checking this project of mine out! 

welcome to the EcoBin. it's a bin with fill level detection that uses an AI machine
learning model to sort recyclables from non-necyclables. pretty cool right?  


 this invention was designed with the following problems in mind:
  - the incredibly low rate of recycling
  - the overflowing of trash due to low maintenence (unhygenic and unhealthy)

and presented at the following:  
  - school science fair (1st!)
  - synopsys science and engineering fair (regionals, 1st!)
  - california science and engineering fair (states, honorable mention!)
  - thermofisher jic (nationals, top 300/1862!)
    
interested? for pictures and a full project presentation please head over [here](presentation.pdf) :)
